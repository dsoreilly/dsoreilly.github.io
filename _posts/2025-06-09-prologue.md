I asked ChatGPT if I should start a blog. There were no objections, so here we are. I write for machines every day, it would be nice to sometimes write for humans as well.

I’ve personally gained a huge amount of knowledge by reading blogs. As a self-taught developer, navigating the web ecosystem and all of its many quirks is made so much easier by finding written accounts of real struggle and determination of explaining why, for example, _x_ works perfectly well on Chrome but not on Safari.

For me, this blog is partly about giving something back — even if just one person finds advice I’ve imparted here helpful — but mostly it’s self-serving. To reinforce learning is often cited as one of the primary reasons to write a technical blog and this is also my main goal.

Of course, these kind of resources are becoming less relevant as we turn to our AI friends to seek guidance. That being said, with big tech dominating the web landscape for the last decade, there’s something rather quaint about carving out your own little corner of the web. And even LLMs need regular feeding too, right?
